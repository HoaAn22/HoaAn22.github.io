## ASSIGNMENT

**Part I: [LEISURE](note. `ˈliʒər`) [TIME](note. `taɪm`)**  
\- In my free time, [#-] I [usually](note. `ˈjuʒəli`) listen to music [#-] or watch [English](note. `ˈɪŋɡlɪʃ`) videos [#-] to relax and [improve](note. `ɪmˈpruv`) my language skills.  
\- I prefer spending my leisure time alone [#-] because I'm an [introverted](note. `ˈɪntroʊˌvɜrtɪd`) person. [#-] Having some [personal](note. `ˈpɜrsɪnɪl`) space [#-] helps me recharge my energy [#-] after a busy day. [#-] It also gives me time [#-] to think and focus on my personal interests, [#-] such as reading or listening to music.  
\- Although I’m not very outgoing, I still try to join some outdoor activities because they help me stay healthy and make new friends.  

**Part II**  
My [greatest](note. `ˈɡreɪtəst`) [personal](note. `ˈpɜrsɪnɪl`) [achievement](note. `əˈʧivmənt`) [#-] is overcoming my fear of public speaking. [#-] I used to feel very [nervous](note. `ˈnɜrvəs`) [#-] whenever I had to speak in front of other people. [#-] Last year, [#-] I had a project presentation at work, [#-] and I decided to face my fear. [#-] I practiced a lot [#-] and asked my friends [#-] for feedback. In the end, I felt more confident [#-] during the presentation. This achievement is important to me [#-] because it helped me believe in myself [#-] and taught me to step out of [#-] my comfort zone.
