1. *Who is your role model?*

My role [model](note. `ˈmɑdəl`) is my academic supervisor at [university](note. `ˌjunəˈvɜrsəti`). He has strong academic [knowledge](note. `ˈnɑləʤ`) and a calm, humble manner. Through his guidance, I learned how to think more [critically](note. `ˈkrɪtɪkli`) and [approach](note. `əˈproʊʧ`) problems in a more [systematic](note. `ˌsɪstəˈmætɪk`) way.

He inspired my interest in learning and helped me become [clearer](note. `ˈklɪrər`) about the path I want to [pursue](note. `pərˈsu`) in the future. At the same time, he made me [realize](note. `ˈriəˌlaɪz`) that I still have many areas to [improve](note. `ɪmˈpruv`).

In the future, I would like to receive advanced training in finance.I am also considering pursuing a master’s degree to deepen my professional knowledge. This training will help me improve my analytical skills and better understand financial systems. It is an important step for my long-term career development.

3. *Do you think being well-organized is a neccessary skill in the workplace? Why/Why not?*

Yes, I think being well-organized is a very important skill in the workplace. It helps people manage their time and tasks more effectively. When someone is well-organized, they can work faster and make fewer mistakes. This skill also reduces stress and improves work quality.

## Part II

Today, I would like to discuss the risks of [Artificial](note. `ˌɑrtəˈfɪʃəl`) Intelligence, which is becoming increasingly important in modern society. 

Artificial Intelligence has brought significant benefits, especially in terms of efficiency and automation. However, as AI continues to develop rapidly, it also creates several serious risks that should not be ignored. 

One major risk of Artificial Intelligence is its impact on employment. Many routine and repetitive jobs are gradually being replaced by intelligent systems, creating challenges for workers who are not prepared to adapt. 

Another important concern is over-reliance on AI. When people depend too much on technology to make decisions, they may lose essential skills such as independent thinking and problem-solving. 

In addition, AI raises serious issues related to privacy and ethics. Large amounts of personal data are collected and analyzed, and without proper control, this information may be misused or abused. 

From my perspective, Artificial Intelligence should be seen as a powerful tool rather than a replacement for human intelligence. To reduce its risks, we need responsible use, proper education, and effective regulations. 

In conclusion, AI has the potential to improve our lives, but only if humans remain in control of how it is developed and applied.
