## OPENING

[Today](note. `təˈdeɪ`), I [would](note. `wʊd`) [like](note. `laɪk`) to [talk](note. tɔk) [about](note. `əˈbaʊt`) a topic that is very close to [our](note. `aʊr`) [daily](note. `ˈdeɪli`) [life](note. `laɪf`), [especially](note. `əˈspɛʃli`) for students and working [people](note. `ˈpipəl`). _That topic is work–life balance._

In [modern](note. `ˈmɑdərn`) [life](note. `laɪf`), [many](note. `ˈmɛni`) people spend a [lot](note. `lɑt`) of time working or [studying](note. `ˈstʌdiɪŋ`). They try to [finish](note. `fɪnɪʃ`) tasks, [meet](note. `mit`) deadlines, and do their best at work. However, when work [takes](note. `teɪks`) too much time, personal life can be [affected](note. `əˈfɛktɪd`).

This [leads](note. `lidz`) to an [important](note. `ɪmˈpɔrtənt`) [question](note. `ˈkwɛʃən`): ***How can we balance work and life in a [healthy](note. `ˈhɛlθi`) way?***

## The Impact of work-life Imbalance

Work–life [imbalance](note. `ɪmˈbæləns`) has many negative effects on [both](note. `boʊθ`) work and personal life.

It happens when people spend too much time working and [not](note. `nɑt`) enough time resting or enjoying personal life.

When this imbalance [continues](note. `kənˈtɪnjuz`) for a long time, it can affect health, relationships, and work performance.
These effects are [common](note. `kənˈtɪnjuz`) in modern life and should not be [ignored](note. `ɪɡˈnɔrd`).

1. ***Stress*** 

[One](note. `wʌn`) common impact is stress.This happens because people face many deadlines, heavy workload, and long working hours. When stress lasts for a long time, people feel worried, tired, and unhappy. Stress affects both work and life.

2. ***Low Work Productivity***

Another impact is low work productivity. When people are too tired, they work longer but not better. They make more mistakes and finish tasks more slowly. The main reason is lack of rest and sleep. This reduces energy and concentration, which affects work quality.

3. ***Losing Family and Social Relationships***

Work–life imbalance can also cause people to lose connection with family and friends. When people work too much, they have little time to talk, meet, or share moments with others. As a result, relationships become weaker. This affects emotional support and can make people feel lonely.

4. ***No Time for Personal Life***

Another important impact is having no time for oneself. People may stop doing hobbies, exercising, or relaxing. This happens because work takes all their time. Without personal time, people feel bored, tired, and less motivated in life.

*Because of these serious impacts, it is important to find ways to balance work and life better.*
