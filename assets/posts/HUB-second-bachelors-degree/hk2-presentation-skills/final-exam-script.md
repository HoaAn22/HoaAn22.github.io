# Final Exam [Script](note. Kịch bản)

## OPENING

Hello, lecturer. My name is [#...]. I was born on November [22nd](note. twenty-second), [2002](note. two thousand and two). I am a student of the English Language program. My student ID number is 040402250092.

[Today](note. `təˈdeɪ`), I [would](note. `wʊd`) [like](note. `laɪk`) to [talk](note. tɔk) [about](note. `əˈbaʊt`) a topic that is very close to our daily life, [especially](note. `əˈspɛʃli`) for students and working [people](note. `ˈpipəl`). _That topic is work–life balance._

In modern life, many people spend a lot of time working or studying. They try to [finish](note. `fɪnɪʃ`) tasks, [meet](note. `mit`) deadlines, and do their best at work. However, when work [takes](note. `teɪks`) too much time, personal life can be [affected](note. `əˈfɛktɪd`).

This [leads](note. `lidz`) to an [important](note. `ɪmˈpɔrtənt`) [question](note. `ˈkwɛʃən`): ***How can we balance work and life in a [healthy](note. `ˈhɛlθi`) way?***

## What is work-life balance

To answer this question, we need to understand what work-life balance is.

Work-life balance means using our time and energy in a good way between work and personal life. 

- Work includes study, jobs, and responsibilities,...
- Life includes family, health, rest, and free time,...

When work and life are balanced, we can work well and still have time to [relax](note.` rɪˈlæks`). This helps us feel happier and less stressed. ***But in [reality](note. `ˌriˈæləˌti`), many people do [not](note. `nɑt`) have good work-life balance.***

## The Impact of work-life Imbalance

Work–life imbalance has many negative effects on [both](note. `boʊθ`) work and personal life.

It happens when people spend too much time working and [not](note. `nɑt`) enough time resting or enjoying personal life.

When this imbalance [continues](note. `kənˈtɪnjuz`) for a long time, it can affect health, relationships, and work performance.
These effects are [common](note. `kənˈtɪnjuz`) in modern life and should not be [ignored](note. `ɪɡˈnɔrd`).

One common impact is stress

## Ways to [Achieve](note. `əˈʧiv`) Work-Life Balance
*There are several practical ways to maintain work–life balance in daily life.*

1. ***Planning work properly.*** The first way is planning work in a reasonable way. Work can be planned by hour, day, or week. With a clear plan, time is used more effectively and stress is reduced.

2. ***Focusing fully during working time*** Another important way is full focus during working time. When attention is not divided, tasks can be finished faster. As a result, more free time is available after work.

3. ***Saying no when necessary.***Knowing when to say no is also important. When we are too busy, accepting extra tasks can lead to pressure and overload. By refusing unnecessary work, we can maintain focus and protect personal time.

4. ***Spending time with family*** Spending time with family plays an important role in balance. Simple activities like talking or eating together bring comfort. This creates emotional support and reduces stress.

5. ***Talking with friends*** Keeping contact with friends is also beneficial. Sharing thoughts and experiences makes people feel less lonely. Positive conversations often improve mood and motivation.

6. ***Having a healthy hobby*** Finally, having a healthy hobby is essential. Activities such as singing or reading allow the mind to rest. Free time spent on hobbies helps restore energy.

*Although these methods are simple, they are effective in real life.*

## PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

From my own experience, keeping a balance between work and life is possible with small actions.

I started by planning my work time clearly and focusing fully when I work. When I feel stressed, I take short breaks, spend time with my family and friends, or do things I enjoy – and take care of myself and love myself more.

These simple habits help me feel more relaxed and keep my motivation. They remind me that balance is not about doing everything, but about choosing what really matters.

## Conclusion

When we manage our time well and love ourselves, we can work better, reduce stress, and enjoy life more.

*Thank you for your attention.*
