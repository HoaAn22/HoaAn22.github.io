# Final Exam [Script](note. Kịch bản)

## OPENING

***(SLIDE 1)*** [Hello](note. `həˈloʊ`), [lecturer](note. `lɛkʧərər`). My name is [#...]. I was born on November [22nd](note. twenty second), [2002](note. two thousand and two). I am a student of the English [Language](note. `ˈlæŋɡwəʤ`) program. My student ID number is 040402250092.

***(SLIDE 2)*** Today, I would like to talk about a topic that is closely related to modern life. It affects how we study, work, and live every day. That topic is ***(TITLE)*** work–life balance.

In today’s [society](note. `səˈsaɪəti`), many people spend most of their time studying or working, which often leaves little time for personal life.

This leads to an important question: ***(SLIDE 3)*** How can we balance work and life in a healthy way?

## What is work-life balance

To [answer](note. `ˈænsər`) this [question](note. `ˈkwɛʃən`), we [need](note. `nid`) to understand ***(SLIDE 4)*** what work-life balance is.  

***(CONTENT)*** Work-life balance means [using](note. `ˈjuzɪŋ`) [our](note. `aʊr`) time and [energy](note. `ˈɛnərʤi`) in a good way [between](note. `bɪˈtwin`) work and personal life. 

Work includes study, jobs, and responsibilities, while life includes family, health, rest, and personal time.

When work and life are balanced, we can work well and still have time to [relax](note.` rɪˈlæks`). [This](note. `ðɪs`) helps us feel happier and less [stressed](note. `strɛst`). But in [reality](note. `ˌriˈæləˌti`), many people do [not](note. `nɑt`) have good work-life balance.

## The Impact of work-life Imbalance

***(SLIDE 5)*** Work–life imbalance affects both work and personal life. It [happens](note. `ˈhæpənz`) when people spend too much time working and [not](note. `nɑt`) [enough](note. `ɪˈnʌf`) time resting or enjoying life. Over time, this can lead to [several](note. `ˈsɛvrəl`) [problems](note. `ˈprɑbləmz`).

***(SLIDE 6)*** [One](note. `wʌn`) [common](note. `ˈkɑmən`) [problem](note. `ˈprɑbləm`) is [stress](note. `strɛs`). Heavy workloads and [deadlines](note. `ˈdɛˌdlaɪnz`) [make](note. `meɪk`) people feel tired and [pressured](NOTE. `ˈprɛʃərd` - Ré_/u.). If stress [continues](note. `kənˈtɪnjuz`) for a long time, it [reduces](note. `rɪˈdusɪz` - ri_'jdu) well-being and daily happiness.

Another [problem](note. `ˈprɑbləm`) is [lower](note. `ˈloʊər`) work [productivity](note. `ˌproʊdəkˈtɪvɪti`). When people do [not](note. `nɑt`) get enough rest, they work longer but [not](note. `nɑt`) better. They [lose](note. `luz`) focus, make more [mistakes](note. `mɪsˈteɪks`), and their work becomes less effective.

***(SLIDE 7)*** Work–life imbalance [also](note. `ˈɔlsoʊ`) affects relationships. People who are always busy have less time for family and friends, [which](note. `wɪʧ`) can [make](note. `meɪk`) [them](note. `ðɛm`) feel disconnected.

Finally, it leaves little time for oneself. [Without](note. `wɪˈθaʊt`) time to [relax](note. `rɪˈlæks`) or enjoy [hobbies](note. `ˈhɑbiz`), [motivation](note. `moʊtəˈveɪʃən`) and [energy](note. `ˈɛnərʤi`) [slowly](note. `ˈsloʊli`) [decrease](note. `ˈdiˌkris`).

*For these [reasons](note. `ˈrizənz`), [keeping](note. `ˈkipɪŋ`) a [healthy](note. `ˈhɛlθi`) balance [between](note. `bɪˈtwin`) work and life is [important](note. `ɪmˈpɔrtənt`).*

## Ways to [Achieve](note. `əˈʧiv`) Work-Life Balance
*There are several practical ways to maintain work–life balance in daily life.*

1. ***Planning work properly.*** 

The first way is planning work in a reasonable way. Work can be planned by hour, day, or week. With a clear plan, time is used more effectively and stress is reduced.

2. ***Focusing fully during working time*** 

Another important way is full focus during working time. When attention is not divided, tasks can be finished faster. As a result, more free time is available after work.

3. ***Saying no when necessary.*** 

Knowing when to say no is also important. When we are too busy, accepting extra tasks can lead to pressure and overload. By refusing unnecessary work, we can maintain focus and protect personal time.

4. ***Spending time with family*** 

Spending time with family plays an important role in balance. Simple activities like talking or eating together bring comfort. This creates emotional support.

5. ***Talking with friends*** 

Keeping contact with friends is also beneficial. Sharing thoughts and experiences makes people feel less lonely. Positive conversations often improve mood and motivation.

6. ***Having a healthy hobby*** 

Finally, having a healthy hobby is essential. Activities such as singing or reading allow the mind to rest. Free time spent on hobbies helps restore energy.

*Although these methods are simple, they are effective in real life.*

## PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

From my own experience, keeping a balance between work and life is possible with small actions.

I started by planning my work time clearly and focusing fully when I work. When I feel stressed, I take short breaks, spend time with my family and friends, or do things I enjoy – and take care of myself and love myself more.

These simple habits help me feel more relaxed and keep my motivation. They remind me that balance is not about doing everything, but about choosing what really matters.

## Conclusion

When we manage our time well and love ourselves, we can work better, reduce stress, and enjoy life more.

*Thank you for your attention.*
