## OPENING

Good morning, [teacher](note. `ˈtiːʧər`) and classmates.

[Today](note. `təˈdeɪ`), I [would](note. `wʊd`) [like](note. `laɪk`) to [talk](note. tɔk) [about](note. `əˈbaʊt`) a topic that is very close to our daily life, [especially](note. `əˈspɛʃli`) for students and working [people](note. `ˈpipəl`). *That topic is work–life balance.*

In modern life, many people spend a lot of time working or studying. They try to finish tasks, meet deadlines, and do their best at work. However, when work takes too much time, personal life can be affected.
