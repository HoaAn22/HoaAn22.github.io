# Final Exam [Script](note. Kịch bản)

## OPENING

Good morning, [teacher](note. `ˈtiːʧər`) and [classmates](note. `ˈklæˌsmeɪts`).

[Today](note. `təˈdeɪ`), I [would](note. `wʊd`) [like](note. `laɪk`) to [talk](note. tɔk) [about](note. `əˈbaʊt`) a topic that is very close to our daily life, [especially](note. `əˈspɛʃli`) for students and working [people](note. `ˈpipəl`). _That topic is work–life balance._

In modern life, many people spend a lot of time working or studying. They try to finish tasks, meet deadlines, and do their best at work. However, when work takes too much time, personal life can be affected.

This leads to an important question: ***How can we balance work and life in a healthy way?***

## What is work-life balance

To answer this question, we need to understand what work-life balance is.

Work-life balance means using our time and energy in a good way between work and personal life. 

- Work includes study, jobs, and responsibilities,...
- Life includes family, health, rest, and free time,...

When work and life are balanced, we can work well and still have time to relax. This helps us feel happier and less stressed. ***But in [reality](note. `ˌriˈæləˌti`), many people do [not](note. `nɑt`) have good work-life balance.***
