**A PARAGRAPHS**  

-  A Paragraph is a [group of](note. t·∫≠p h·ª£p) sentences about [a central idea](note. m·ªôt √Ω t∆∞·ªüng trung t√¢m - ch√≠nh).  
- A paragraph [has](note. hi·ªán t·∫°i ƒë∆°n) a clear purpose, such as to list, to show [causes or effects](note. nguy√™n nh√¢n ho·∫∑c k·∫øt qu·∫£) of something, or to [argure a point](note. tranh lu·∫≠n v·ªÅ m·ªôt quan ƒëi·ªÉm).  
- Every part of a paragraph has a specific function, and every part is important.  

The three main parts of a paragraph are:  
    - [The topic sentences](note. C√¢u ch·ªß ƒë·ªÅ).  
    - [The supporting sentences](note. C√¢u h·ªó tr·ª£, gi·∫£i th√≠ch l·∫≠p lu·∫≠n).  
    - [The concluding sentence](note. C√¢u k·∫øt lu·∫≠n).

**THE TOPIC SENTENCE.**

- The topic sentence tells the reader the main idea or thought the the writer is trying to [express](note.  `…™kÀàspr…õs` di·ªÖn ƒë·∫°t).
- It is a one-sentence summary of the [entire](note. `…™nÀàta…™…ôr` to√†n b·ªô) paragraph.
- Other sentences in the parapraph [help](note. `h…õlp`) to develop the iead presented in the topic sentence.
- The organization of a parapraph is based on the topic sentence.
- **A TOPIC SENTENCE = TOPIC + [THE CONTROLLING IDEA](note. √Ω ch√≠nh).**
- The controlling iead guides the main subject in the the direction that the writer wants to take it.

\- **Controlling idea**: have changed [enormously](note. `…™Ààn…îrm…ôsli` v√¥ c√πng, r·∫•t nhi·ªÅu, to l·ªõn) in the past 10 years.
